    <p style="text-align: left;">
        <span>
            This paragraph assumes the style text-align: left;, which causes the line 
            boxes within the element to line up along the left inner content edge of the 
            paragraph.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">
        <span>
            This paragraph assumes the style text-align: right;, which causes the line 
            boxes within the element to line up along the right inner content edge of the 
            parapraph.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        <span>
            This paragraph assumes the style text-align: center;, which causes the line 
            boxes within the element to line up their centers with the center of the content area 
            of the paragraph
        </span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <span>
            This paragraph assumes the style text-align: justify;, which causes the line 
            boxes within the element to align their left and right edges to the left and right inner 
            content edges of the paragraph.  The exception is the last line box, whose right 
            edge does not align with the right content edge of the paragraph. (In right-to-left 
            languages, the left edge of the last line box would not be so aligned.)
