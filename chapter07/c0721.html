                The text in this paragraph has been wrapped with a span element. This helps to 
                visualize the limits of each line's box. Note that in many cases the borders actually 
                pass each other, this is because the border is drawn around the outside of the 
                element's content, and so it sticks one pixel beyond the actual limit of the content 
                area (which would technically fall in the space between pixels).
