        <p>This paragraph has a line-height of 1.5 times its font-size.  In addition, 
        any elements within it <small>such as this small element</small> also have 
        line-heights 1.5 times their font-size...and that includes <big>this big 
        element right here</big>.  By using a scaling factor, line-heights scale 
        to match the font-size of any element.
