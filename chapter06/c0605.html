        This paragraph assumes the style text-align: left;, which causes the line 
        boxes within the element to line up along the left inner content edge of the 
        paragraph.

    <p id="p2">
        This paragraph assumes the style text-align: right;, which causes the line 
        boxes within the element to line up along the right inner content edge of the paragraph.
    </p>
    <p id="p3">
        This paragraph assumes the style text-align: center;, which causes the line 
        boxes within the element to line up their centers with the center of the content
        area of the paragraph.
    </p>
    <p id="p4">
        This paragraph assumes the style text-align: justify;, which causes the line
        boxes within the element to align their left and right edges to the left and right inner
         content edges of the paragraph.  The exception is the last line box, whose right 
         edge does not align with the right content edge of the paragraph. (In right-to-left languages, the left 
         edge of the last line box would not be so aligned.)
