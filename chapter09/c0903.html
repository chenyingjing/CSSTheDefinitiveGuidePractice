            A normal paragraph. Thanks to the styles in this document, all 
            paragraphs have a gray background color.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another normal paragraph. As we can see, the paragraphs are all 
            that have gray backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Still a third paragraph. More gray.
