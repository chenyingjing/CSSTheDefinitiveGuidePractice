        <h1>Emerging Into The Light</h1>
        <p>
            When the city of <a href="iiowwk">Seattle</a> was founded, it was on a tidal flood plain in the 
            <a href="http://www.baidu.com">Puget Sound</a>. If this seems like a bad move, it was; but 
            then <a href="iwo29">the founders</a> were men from the Midwest who didn't know a whole lot about 
            tides.
