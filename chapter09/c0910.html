        <h1>Emerging Into The Light</h1>
        <p>
            When the city of <a href="kiwo">Seattle</a> was founded, it was on a tidal flood plain in the <a href="http://www.baidu.com">Puget sound</a>.
            If this seems like a bad move, it was, but then <a href="weiwo">the founders</a> were men from the 
            Midwest who didn't know a whole lot about tides. You'd think they'd have figure it all 
            out before actually building the town, but apparently not. A city was established right 
            there, and construction work began.
