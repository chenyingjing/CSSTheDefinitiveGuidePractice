            This paragraph, unremarkable in most ways, does contain an inline element. 
            This inline contains some <strong>strongly emphasized text, which is 
            so marked to make an important point</strong>.  The rest of the element's 
            content is normal anonymous inline content.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a second paragraph.  There's nothing remarkable about it, really.
            Please move along.
