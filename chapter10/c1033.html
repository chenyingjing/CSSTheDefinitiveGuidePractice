            This paragraph does <em>not</em> establish a containing block for any of its 
            descendant elements that are absolutely positioned.  Therefore, the absolutely 
            positioned <b>boldface </b> element it contains will be positioned with 
            respect to the initial containing block.
        </p>

            Thanks to 'position: relative', this paragraph establishes a containing 
            block for any of its descendant elements that are absolutely positioned.
            Since there is such an element-- <em>that is to say, <b>a boldfaced 
            element that is absolutely positioned,</b> placed with respect to its containing 
            block (the paragraph)</em>, it will appear within the element box generated 
            by the paragraph.
