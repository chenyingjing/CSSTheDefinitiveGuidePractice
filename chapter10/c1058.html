            Even there, however, the divorce is not complete <em>and never can be.</em>
            I've been saying this in public presentations for a while now, and it bears repetition
            here: you can have structure without style, but you can't have style without structure.
            You have to have elements(and, also, classes and IDs and such) in order to apply 
            style.  If I have a document on the Web containing literally nothing but text, as in no 
            HTML or other markup, just text, then it can't be styled.
