            In his first public response to questions about the payment, the president 
            <img src="yinyangss.jpg" align="right">

            and he declined to say whether he had ever set up a fund for Cohen to cover such expenses.

            Trump's brief remarks Thursday afternoon raised the stakes for the president on two fronts. Daniels's attorney immediately suggested that Trump's version of events would be shown to be untruthful if he is deposed in a lawsuit brought by the adult-film star. And Trump's lack of knowledge about a hefty payment made in the final weeks of his presidential campaign could have implications for complaints now before the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department about the arrangement's legality.
