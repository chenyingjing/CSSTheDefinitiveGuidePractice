            In his first public response to questions about the payment, the president

            said he did not know where his attorney, Michael Cohen, got the money, 
            and he declined to say whether he had ever set up a fund for Cohen to cover such expenses.

            Trump's brief remarks Thursday afternoon raised the stakes for the president on two fronts. 
            <img src="yinyangss.jpg">
            Daniels's attorney immediately suggested that Trump's version of events would be shown to be untruthful if he is deposed in a lawsuit brought by the adult-film star. And Trump's lack of knowledge about a hefty payment made in the final weeks of his presidential campaign could have implications for complaints now before the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department about the arrangement's legality.

            The government watchdog group Common Cause has argued that the payment was made to influence the 2016 presidential election and therefore was an illegal in-kind contribution to Trump's campaign that was never publicly disclosed.
