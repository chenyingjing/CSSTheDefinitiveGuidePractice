        <p>
            This paragraph has a 5-pixel margin, a solid border, and a border width of 50 
            pixels. Yikes!
        </p>
        <p>
            This paragraph is the same as the last one, stylistically speaking. The five pixels 
            of separation is due to the margins, of course.
