        <h2>I'm an H2 and I'm pround!</h2>
        <p>
            The paragraphs that follow on will be separated as people expect, 
            but not in the traditional manner: only the bottom margin is used 
            to enforce this separation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The top margins have been removed. This allows the first paragraph after 
            an h2(which has had its bottom argin removed) to get up close to the h2 
            without the use of an adjacent-sibiling selector, which some browsers do 
            not support.
        </p>
        <p>
            Interparagraph <strong>spacing</strong>. Catch the wave!
        </p>
        <p>
            This paragraph, like the others, contains a small amount of <strong>strongly emphasized text</strong> that has 
            been styled as indicated.
        </p>
        <p>
            This paragraph contains a bunch of images in the text <img src="smile.png" style="margin: 25px" />. Each one 
            has different margins <img src="smile.png" />. Some of these margins are negative, and some are positive <img src="smile.png" /> .
            Since replaced element boxes affect line height, the margins on these images can alter the space between 
            baselines <img src="smile.png" />. This is to be expected, and is something authors must take 
            into consideration <img src="smile.png" style="margin: -25px"/>.
