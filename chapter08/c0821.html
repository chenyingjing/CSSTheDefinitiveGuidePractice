                This paragraph is contained within a DIV that has a width of 200 pixels,
                so its padding will be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent element.
                Given the declared width of 200 pixels, the padding will be 20 pixels on 
                all sides.
            </p>

                This paragraph is contained within a DIV with a width of 100 pixels,
                so its padding will still be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent.
                There will, therefore, be half as much padding on this paragraph as that 
                on the first paragraph.
