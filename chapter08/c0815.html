        <h1>An H1 element with a complex border</h1>
        <p>
            This paragraph contains some ordinary, unstyled text, whose 
            purpose is to provide filler. This will help distinguish the styled 
            element from the others.
        </p>
        <p class="roof">
            Up on the rooftop, reindeer pause / Out jumps good old Santa 
            Claus / Down through the chimney with lots of toys / All for the 
            little ones' Christmas joys...
        </p>
        <p>
            Uh-oh-more filler. Couldn't the author have been more creative 
            than this?
