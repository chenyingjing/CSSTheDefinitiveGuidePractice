        <div style="width: 200px; border: 1px dotted;">
            <p>This paragraph is contained within a DIV that has a width of 200 pixels,
                so its margin will be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent (the
                DIV).
                Given the declared width of 200 pixels, the margin will be 20 pixels on 
                all sides.
            </p>

        <div style="width: 100px; border: 1px dotted;">
            <p>
                This paragraph is contained within a DIV with a width of 100 pixels,
                so its margin will still be 10% of the width of the paragraph's parent.
                There will, therefore, be half as much margin on this paragraph as that 
                on the first paragraph.
